# Using Miniconda

Miniconda allows us to keep dependencies for each project separate and staticly defined, so that each time we run a piupeline, we use the same versions of each piece of software.

## Install Miniconda

Navigate to your project, and run the following commands:

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

chmod +x Minicona3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

This should download and activate a script that will allow you to download the latest version of Miniconda.
